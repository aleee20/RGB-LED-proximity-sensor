# RGB-LED-proximity-sensor
A car parking sensor, implemented using the WOWKI platform. The sensor warns the driver by changing an RGB LED from green to red and by transmitting an audio signal, when there are other objects in the car's perimeter. The sensor sends the exact distance to an I2C LCD display.
